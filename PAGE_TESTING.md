# Player 2 - 4 Card Game Interface

### Page Description

The `player_2.html` file implements the interface for a two-player card game using HTML and CSS. Each player is presented with a hand of cards and a discard pile. The HTML elements are styled using CSS to properly position these components on the page, including visual effects such as hover transformations for cards. This code does not handle the game's logic.
