# Day/Time/TimeZone for scheduled team weekly meetings:
Saturdays at 10am MST.

# Vision Statement:
We are creating a web application version of our own take on the game Love Letter, complete with home page website, user login, and site navigation capabilities.

# Motivation:
To develop new skills relating to creating, hosting, and deploying a web-based application. We would also like to use this as a way to showcase our skills in a project portfolio for professional use.

# Risks to Project Completion:
* Lack of foundational knowledge; we will need to acquire many new skills to accomplish this, including but not limited to: web hosting, integration of the app into the site, UI design.
* This project could take a considerable amount of time, but we hope it is feasible in the length of time available in this course.

# Mitigation Strategy for Above Risks:
* Self-driven learning of required technologies to quickly begin iterating our project.
* Utilizing the Agile process to maintain regular and productive communication to avoid roadblocks and help mitigate issues as they arise.

# Development Method:
Scrum/Agile. We are going to have weekly agile meetings where we will talk about the previous week's progress, goals for the next week, and roadblocks to upcoming tasks we're trying to deploy. Collin Coakley is designated as our team's Scrum master, and we are all collaborating on task ideas and assignments. We are communicating regularly through discord so we can have ongoing conversations to stay agile.
