# Day/Time/TimeZone for scheduled team weekly meetings:
Saturdays at 10am MST.

# Vision Statement:
We are creating a web application version of our own take on the game Love Letter, complete with home page website, user login, and site navigation capabilities.

# Motivation:
To develop new skills relating to creating, hosting, and deploying a web-based application. We would also like to use this as a way to showcase our skills in a project portfolio for professional use.

# Risks to Project Completion:
* Lack of foundational knowledge; we will need to acquire many new skills to accomplish this, including but not limited to: web hosting, integration of the app into the site, UI design.
* This project could take a considerable amount of time, but we hope it is feasible in the length of time available in this course.

# Mitigation Strategy for Above Risks:
* Self-driven learning of required technologies to quickly begin iterating our project.
* Utilizing the Agile process to maintain regular and productive communication to avoid roadblocks and help mitigate issues as they arise.

# Development Method:
Scrum/Agile.
