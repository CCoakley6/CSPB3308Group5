## üìä Final Status Report

### üéâ What We Completed

We have successfully developed a web-based card game that encompasses various components and technologies. The main aspects of our project include:

1. **Front-End Development**: We utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript to design and create user interface of the game. This includes five main pages:
- **Landing Page**: This page serves as the entry point for users. It contains navigation bars, a welcome section, game rules, a game history table and a link redirecting to `About Us` page. The navigation bars at the top offers links to `Home` page, `Session` page, `About Us` page and our github repository. 
- **Session Page**: This page provides the funtionality for users to create and join game, as well as view existing game sessions.
- **About Us Page**: This page provides information about each team member behind the game and its development process.
- **Game Page**: The core of the application, this page hosts the actual card game for 2 - 4 players, where players can interact and enjoy the gameplay in a specific room.
- **Error Page**: This page could be displayed when users visit non-existent or broken links.

2. **Back-end Development**
- Python served as the primary programming language for the back-end development.
- We employed the Flask framework to build the server-side logic and handle requests from the front-end.
- Flask-SocketIO facilitated the seamless communication between players, enhancing the interactive experience.

3. **Database and Hosting**
- PostgreSQL was chosen as the database system to store relevant game data such as player information, game history, and session information.
- Hosting on Render allows our web application to be publicly accessible and provides a reliable environment for users to access our card game.

Overall, we've successfully brought together various technologies to create a functional web-based card game, encompassing both front-end and back-end components. We're excited to present our game to users and are confident in its functionality and design.
